<h3>Seasonal Considerations for Berlin Visits</h3>
<p><strong>Spring (April-May):</strong> Mild temperatures and blooming parks make this ideal for outdoor exploration and walking tours of historical sites.
<strong>Summer (June-August):</strong> Long daylight hours and numerous outdoor festivals, though this is peak tourist season with higher prices and larger crowds.
<strong>Autumn (September-October):</strong> Comfortable temperatures and cultural season beginnings, with fewer tourists and excellent conditions for museum visits.
<strong>Winter (November-February):</strong> Christmas markets and indoor cultural activities, though weather can be cold and daylight hours are limited.</p>
<h3>Transportation and Logistics</h3>
<p>Berlin's excellent public transportation system includes U-Bahn (subway), S-Bahn (urban rail), buses, and trams that connect all major attractions.
